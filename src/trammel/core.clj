(defn- keys-apply
  "Takes a function, a set of keys, and a map and applies the function to the map on the given keys.  
   A new map of the results of the function applied to the keyed entries is returned.
  "
  [f ks m]
  {:pre  [(or (fn? f) (keyword? f) (symbol? f))
          (except (coll? ks) (map? ks))
          (map? m)]
   :post [(map? %)]}
  (let [only (select-keys m ks)] 
    (zipmap (keys only)
            (map f (vals only)))))

(defn- manip-map
  "Takes a function, a set of keys, and a map and applies the function to the map on the given keys.  
   A modified version of the original map is returned with the results of the function applied to each 
   keyed entry.
  "
  [f ks m]
  {:pre  [(or (fn? f) (keyword? f) (symbol? f))
          (except (coll? ks) (map? ks))
          (map? m)]
   :post [(map? %)
          (= (keys %) (keys m))]}  
  (conj m (keys-apply f ks m)))

(defn- build-pre-post-map
  "Takes a vector of the form `[pre ... => post ...]` and infers the expectations described
   therein.  The map that comes out will look like Clojure's default pre- anlein d post-conditions
   map.  If the argument is already a map then it's assumed that the default pre/post map is used and
   as a result is used directly without manipulation.
  "
  [cnstr]
  (if (vector? cnstr)
    (let [[L M R] (partition-by #{'=>} cnstr)]
      {:pre  (when (not= L '(=>)) L)
       :post (if (= L '(=>)) M R)})
    cnstr))

(defn- build-constraints-map 
  "Takes the corresponding arglist and a vector of the contract expectations, the latter of which looks 
   like any of the following:

       [(= 0 _)] or [number?] ;; only the pre-
       [number? => number?]   ;; a pre- and post-
       [=> number?]           ;; only a post-
       [foo bar => baz]       ;; 2 pre- and 1 post-

   It then takes this form and builds a pre- and post-condition map of the form:

       {:pre  [(foo x) (bar x)]
        :post [(baz %)]}
  "
  [args cnstr]
  [args 
   (->> (build-pre-post-map cnstr)
        (manip-map (partial funcify '[%]) [:post])
        (manip-map (partial funcify args) [:pre]))])

(defn- build-contract 
  "Expects a seq representing an arity-based expectation of the form:

        [[x] {:pre [(foo x)] :post [(bar %)]}]

   It then uses this data to build another list reprsenting a specific arity body
   for a higher-order function with attached pre- and post-conditions that directly 
   calls the function passed in:

        ([f x] {:pre [(foo x)] :post [(bar %)]} (f x))

   However, the picture is slightly more compilcated than that because Clojure does
   not have disparate pre-/post-conditions.  Therefore, it's on me to provide a
   slightly more crystaline picture of the condition failure when it occurs.  As a
   result the body of the contract is interwoven with `try`/`catch` blocks to catch
   and examine the contents of `AssertionErrors` and based on context rethrow them
   with more information.  At the moment this information only takes the form of a
   richer assertion message.

                                           (cond (symbol? item) [item]
                                                 (map? item) [(:as item)]
                                                 :else [item]))
                                         args))))
                   (catch AssertionError pre#
                     (throw (AssertionError. (str "Pre-condition failure in " ~n "! " (.getMessage pre#))))))]
        (try
          ((fn []
             ~(select-keys pre-post-map [:post])
             ret#))
          (catch AssertionError post#
            (throw (AssertionError. (str "Post-condition failure in " ~n "! " (.getMessage post#))))))))))

(defmacro contract
  "The base contract form returning a higher-order function that can then be partially
   applied to an existing function to 'apply' a contract.  Take for example a simple
   contract that describes an expectation for a function that simply takes one or two
   numbers and returns the double:
   
       (def doubler-contract
         (contract doubler
           “Ensures that when given a number,
            the result is doubled.”
           [x] [number? => (= (* 2 x) %)]

           [x y] [(every? number? [x y])
                  =>
                  (= (* 2 (+ x y)) %)]))

   You can then partially apply this contract with an existing function:

       (def doubler
            (partial doubler-contract
                     #(* 2 %)))
       
       (def bad-doubler
            (partial doubler-contract
                     #(* 3 %)))

   And then running these functions will be checked against the contract at runtime:

       (doubler 2)
       ;=> 4
       
       (bad-doubler 2)
       ; java.lang.AssertionError:
       ;   Assert failed: (= (* 2 x) %)

   Similar results would occur for the 2-arity versions of `doubler` and `bad-doubler`.

   While it's fine to use `partial` directly, it's better to use the `with-constraints` function
   found in this same library.

   If you're so inclined, you can inspect the terms of the contract via its metadata, keyed on
   the keyword `:constraints`.

  [n docstring & constraints]

(defn with-constraints
  "A contract combinator.
   
   Takes a target function and a number of contracts and returns a function with the contracts
   applied to the original.  This is the preferred way to apply a contract previously created
   using `contract` as the use of `partial` may not work as implementation details change.

(defmacro defcontract

  [name docstring & forms]

       (defconstrainedfn sqr

         (* n n))

   Like the `contract` macro, multiple arity functions can be defined where each argument vector 
   is immediately followed by the relevent arity expectations.  This macro will also detect
   if a map is in that constraints position and use that instead under the assumption that
   Clojure's `:pre`/`:post` map is used instead.
